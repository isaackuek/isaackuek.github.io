# Foundation Compass Template

<<<<<<< HEAD
The easiest way to get started with Foundation + Compass.

## Requirements

  * Ruby 1.9+
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [compass](http://compass-style.org/): `gem install compass`
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `npm install bower -g`

## Quickstart

  * [Download this starter compass project and unzip it](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-compass-template/archive/master.zip)
  * Run `bower install` to install the latest version of Foundation
  
Then when you're working on your project, just run the following command:

```bash
compass watch
```

## Upgrading

If you'd like to upgrade to a newer version of Foundation down the road just run:

```bash
bower update
```

Welcome!

This is a personal portfolio made specifically for INFO 424 Information Visualization and Aesthetics focused on showing the design process, models used for the final infographic, the final infographic and a video describing the experience of building the infographic and more information about the author.

The site will feature use of the Bootstrap framework to speed up the building process. Jekyll will also be leveraged as much as possible. The site will hopefully be expanded in the future to include content from other relevant classes.
