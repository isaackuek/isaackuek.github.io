						<p>
							Craft Beer has a long history in the United States. I took important events from the early 1900s and placed those events on a timeline display. Both displays exhibit magnitude, and the distances between events.

					<div class="large-6 columns">
						<p>
							<strong>How I emulated my models:</strong>
							<br>
							Consistent with my color model, I used a navy blue background, and orange and teal foreground colors. I attempted to have a balance of orange and teal to not clutter the displays. The body text has elements taken from my base model, with an attempt to estabish a visual heirarcy with the text size and weights.
