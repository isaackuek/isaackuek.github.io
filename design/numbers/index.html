							In these boxes, you should describe what the display is showing, then describe the evolutionary process. For example, you might say something like this "I've created a set of icons to represent different aspects of....I also created a simple drawing to show what ...looked like.
							In response to feedback, I simplified 1 of the icons to make it look more like the others and more consistent with my base model.... In the final display, I used the icons in my relationship diagram to show...."

						<p>
							<strong>How I emulated my models:</strong>
							<br>
							To keep the same color scheme as my color model,
							I used the same pale tan as a background, used the blue color as my base color and orange for highlights. For the title, labels and body text, I used the same type styles and weights as my text model. To emulate my base model, I used the same strategy of left-aligning the title and putting a thin bar below it"
