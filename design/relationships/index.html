						<h3>Evolution of Beer Types in Washington</h3>

						<p>
							I created two relationship displays to portray the various types of beer microbreweries produced in Washington. To simplify the process, I chose only a handful of beers with exceptional reviews. The venn diagram better shows the breweries that produce more than one type of beer while the network diagram better shows the many variety of beers available.

							<strong>How I emulated my models:</strong>
							<br>
							To keep the same color scheme as my color model,
							I used the same navy blue as the background, and white (and the occasional orange) for foreground text. To emulate my base model, I used several forms of shading in the venn diagram and in both displays, the title follows the same style used in the base model. For both displays, I utilized the same fonts used in the text model.

						<h3>First Iteration</h3>
						<div class="large-4 columns">
							<h4>Critique #1</h4>
							<p>
								He liked how the venn diagram display highlighted the different types of breweries and how several breweries made different types of beers. He preferred the network diagram display since it laid out the breweries more clearly and followed a semi-circle shape. He suggested experimenting with font weights to make the breweries that made more beer types stand out more.
