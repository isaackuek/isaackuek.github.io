						<h3>Evolution of Beer Types in Washington</h3>

							I created two relationship displays to portray the various types of beer microbreweries produced in Washington. To simplify the process, I chose only a handful of beers with exceptional reviews. The venn diagram better shows the breweries that produce more than one type of beer while the network diagram better shows the many variety of beers available.

							<strong>How I emulated my models:</strong>
							<br>
							To keep the same color scheme as my color model,
							I used the same navy blue as the background, and white (and the occasional orange) for foreground text. To emulate my base model, I used several forms of shading in the venn diagram and in both displays, the title follows the same style used in the base model. For both displays, I utilized the same fonts used in the text model.

						<h3>First Iteration</h3>
						<div class="large-4 columns">
							<h4>Critique #1</h4>
							<p>
								He liked how the venn diagram display highlighted the different types of breweries and how several breweries made different types of beers. He preferred the network diagram display since it laid out the breweries more clearly and followed a semi-circle shape. He suggested experimenting with font weights to make the breweries that made more beer types stand out more.

							<h4>Critique #2</h4>
							<p>
								He found that to convey the idea better, the network display performed better since the orange text was easier to spot compared to the venn diagram display. He liked the relationships in the venn diagram display since it had a sense of a ‘mixing’ feel, akin to brewing. However, the lines in the network display was more pleasing. He suggested to develop more visual structure in the venn diagram display to better develop the idea.

							<h4>Critique #3</h4>
							<p>
								He felt that there were too many circles in the venn diagram display and looked a little lopsided. However, he noted that the visual hierarchy in the network display was more pleasing than the venn diagram. However, he liked the potential that the venn diagram display had and suggested to relate the style with the process of making beer. He also suggested experimenting with the concept of bubbles in a pint glass.
